# rblxinfoapi
I've always wanted to find a quicker solution to background checks. I know it's a kids game but there is a LOT of LARP on it. With larp come people who want to ruin the fun, so, here's something.
This uses Roblox's web API(users.roblox.com) to find quick information on an user through their ID that gets "assigned" to their account when created. Group information, display names, alt indicators, you name it - all through the power of Python. (I hate my life)

# Install
You must have **requests** installed through **pip**:
```pip install requests```

Requests SHOULD come preinstalled when installing the latest version of Python, however, it is in your best interests to install it just to make sure.

It is also in your best interests to keep **main.py** in a separate folder to keep everything organized and to make space for **groups_info.txt** which gets automatically created when the script is run successfully.

# Disclaimer
Remember, Roblox API is **VERY** limited to the public. I would of added so much more if I was able to do so, however, due to restrictions, nope.
If you have any questions, add me on Discord @ neminolobelyn.

# Credits
This was created mainly by me. Some levels(letter and number patterns used for alt indicators) were created with the help of our best friend, ChatGPT. Moral support was given to me by my best friend who, sadly, isn't on GitHub.
